Just so you guys know probably within a week there will be a major real-time system change to Discord.
the /gateway call will need the auth token because gateways will be assigned around a consistent hash ring
If you conncet to the wrong gateway it will send you a redirect opcode with the URL to the correct one
But the easiest way to be ready for this is to just send the auth token to /api/gateway and then you dont need to worry about it

kk

But the redirect opcode can be also fired if the servers rebalance
but doubt that will be happening for a bit after the upgrade
Voltana09/06/2015
I believe most websocket implementations should handle redirects auto
(hopefully)
Stanislav09/06/2015
its not a websocket redirect
its an event on the websocket
Voltana09/06/2015
ohhh
okay, that's a bit more work
Stanislav09/06/2015
its special cause gateways support resuming a session id
instead of identify you send a resume
with the previous session id
and it keeps going on the new node
Voltana09/06/2015
gotcha
Stanislav09/06/2015
This way we can seamless move people between gateways during DDoS or just scale up ðŸ˜ƒ
also works for timeouts (aka cloudflare issue)
Voltana09/06/2015
does this affect only data websockets, or voice as well?
Stanislav09/06/2015
only the gateway one
voice wont change
Voltana09/06/2015
kk
thanks for the headsup ðŸ˜„
Danny09/06/2015
luckily I migrated my /api/gateway call to use auth lol
izy52109/06/2015
@Stanislav Do you have an example of one of those redirect events?
Stanislav09/06/2015
opcode is 7
and the data is just
{"url": "new websocket url here"}
izy52109/06/2015
Ok, thanks
Stanislav09/06/2015
If you want to support resuming a session you need to keep the session_id in your websocket instance.. and also keep track of the 's'  variable aka seq on events (keep last one)
and when you try reconnect after a DC or a redirect
send opcode 6 with {'session_id': session_id, 'seq': seq}
instead of identify
Voltana09/06/2015
I hate race conditions >.>
gonna redesign slightly so redirects work xD
hydrabolt09/06/2015
@Stanislav what's this change? I can't scroll up enough ðŸ˜¦
Voltana09/06/2015
/gateway requires auth
hydrabolt09/06/2015
Oh I know that ðŸ˜›
Voltana09/06/2015
can also get opcode 7 on non-voice websocket to redirect
includes a url parameter
hydrabolt09/06/2015
Oh
Voltana09/06/2015
after connecting to the  other url, "send opcode 6 with {'session_id': session_id, 'seq': seq}"
hydrabolt09/06/2015
Wouldn't there be some dropped packets in that case??
What's seq
Voltana09/06/2015
"and also keep track of the 's'  variable aka seq on events (keep last one)"
you cant scroll up like 10 lines? o.O
lol
Stanislav09/06/2015
if seq matches it means you lost nothing and server will accept the resume
server also buffers all packets while your reconnecting to new server
hydrabolt09/06/2015
Ah ok
But what is seq
Stanislav09/06/2015
every message will have a seq
's'
keep the last one
hydrabolt09/06/2015
Ohh
Stanislav09/06/2015
alawys
always
hydrabolt09/06/2015
Okay gotcha!
Thanks
Voltana09/06/2015
int, I assume?
Stanislav09/06/2015
